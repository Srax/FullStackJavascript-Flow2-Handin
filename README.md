# Period-2 Node.js, Express + JavaScript Backend Testing, NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

Note: This description is too big for a single exam-question. It will be divided up into separate questions for the exam

### Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform?

Acording to StackOverflow's [Most Popular Technologies](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), for the sixth year in a row, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language and Node.js continues to be the most commonly used techonolgy in the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools" category.

The reason Node.js is one of the most commonly used frameworks is due to it's growing community and the fact that its package manager "npm", is now the largest software registry on the web.

>"My sense about popularity/trends/reasons:
>1) Javascript is currently the only language that runs in web browsers...so it is currently the only real language for front end development, and people like to use the language they know best for back end too. Some javascript front end frameworks have near variants that can be used for native mobile application development too.

>2) The combo of 1) and the node.js framework/package system is giving Javascript the most momentum of any language in back end web development, thought it is starting from a low base. And,, as the article points out, back end is more conservative.

>3) Javascript libraries/frameworks have a greater degree of fragmentation than other languages.

>4) New develoopments in web-assembly and compilation to Javascript make it likely that in the future there will be more use of statically typed languages compiling to code that runs on both web browsers and node or other back end Javascript compatible franeworks." - [- "Josh
